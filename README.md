# Family tree

## Description

The end goal of this app would be to create a family tree for each user not in the same family.

## Motivation

Since my family is huge, this project aims to build a family tree so I can avoid losing contact with my family throughout the world.

My family is mainly living in France and the US. 

This project also aims to discover new technologies I am not familiar with.

## Stack
SvelteKit is used for the frontend.

Go is used for the backend.

MySQL is used for the database.
